/**
 * Wrapper around an ExecutorService that allows you to easily submit {@link Callable}s, get results via iteration,
 * and handle failure quickly. When a submitted callable throws an exception in its thread this
 * will result in a {@code RuntimeException} when iterating over results. Typical usage is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create an ExecutorService and pass it to the constructor.</li>
 * <li>Create Callables and ensure that they respond to interruption, e.g. regularly call: <pre>{@code
 *     if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
 *         throw new RuntimeException("The thread was interrupted, likely indicating failure in a sibling thread.");
 *     }}</pre></li>
 * <li>Pass the callables to the {@code submit()} method.</li>
 * <li>Call {@code finishedSubmitting()}.</li>
 * <li>Iterate over this object (e.g. with a foreach loop) to get results from the callables.
 * Each iteration will block waiting for the next result.
 * If one of the callables throws an unhandled exception or the thread is interrupted during iteration
 * then {@link ExecutorService#shutdownNow()} will be called resulting in all still running callables being interrupted,
 * and a {@code RuntimeException} will be thrown </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * You can also call {@code abort()} to shut down the threads yourself.

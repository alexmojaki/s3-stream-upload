/**
 * Manages streaming of data to S3 without knowing the size beforehand and without keeping it all in memory or
 * writing to disk.
 * <p>
 * The data is split into chunks and uploaded using the multipart upload API.
 * The uploading is done on separate threads, the number of which is configured by the user.
 * <p>
 * After creating an instance with details of the upload, use {@link StreamTransferManager#getMultiPartOutputStreams()}
 * to get a list
 * of {@link MultiPartOutputStream}s. As you write data to these streams, call
 * {@link MultiPartOutputStream#checkSize()} regularly. When you finish, call {@link MultiPartOutputStream#close()}.
 * Parts will be uploaded to S3 as you write.
 * <p>
 * Once all streams have been closed, call {@link StreamTransferManager#complete()}. Alternatively you can call
 * {@link StreamTransferManager#abort()}
 * at any point if needed.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example. A lot of the code relates to setting up threads for creating data unrelated to the library. The
 * essential parts are commented.
* <pre>{@code
    AmazonS3Client client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCreds);
    int numStreams = 2;
    int numUploadThreads = 2;
    int queueCapacity = 2;
    int partSize = 5;

    // Setting up
    final StreamTransferManager manager = new StreamTransferManager(bucket, key, client, numStreams,
                                                                    numUploadThreads, queueCapacity, partSize);
    final List<MultiPartOutputStream> streams = manager.getMultiPartOutputStreams();

    ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numStreams);
    for (int i = 0; i < numStreams; i++) {
        final int streamIndex = i;
        pool.submit(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                try {
                    MultiPartOutputStream outputStream = streams.get(streamIndex);
                    for (int lineNum = 0; lineNum < 1000000; lineNum++) {
                        String line = generateData(streamIndex, lineNum);

                        // Writing data and potentially sending off a part
                        outputStream.write(line.getBytes());
                        try {
                            outputStream.checkSize();
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                            throw new RuntimeException(e);
                        }
                    }

                    // The stream must be closed once all the data has been written
                    outputStream.close();
                } catch (Exception e) {

                    // Aborts all uploads
                    manager.abort(e);
                }
            }
        });
    }
    pool.shutdown();
    pool.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    // Finishing off
    manager.complete();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The final file on S3 will then usually be the result of concatenating all the data written to each stream,
 * in the order that the streams were in in the list obtained from {@code getMultiPartOutputStreams()}. However this
 * may not be true if multiple streams are used and some of them produce less than 5 MB of data. This is because the multipart
 * upload API does not allow the uploading of more than one part smaller than 5 MB, which leads to fundamental limits
 * on what this class can accomplish. If order of data is important to you, then either use only one stream or ensure
 * that you write at least 5 MB to every stream.
 * <p>
 * While performing the multipart upload this class will create instances of {@link InitiateMultipartUploadRequest},
 * {@link UploadPartRequest}, and {@link CompleteMultipartUploadRequest}, fill in the essential details, and send them
 * off. If you need to add additional details then override the appropriate {@code customise*Request} methods and
 * set the required properties within.
 * <p>
 * This class does not perform retries when uploading. If an exception is thrown at any stage the upload will be aborted and the
 * exception rethrown, wrapped in a {@code RuntimeException}.

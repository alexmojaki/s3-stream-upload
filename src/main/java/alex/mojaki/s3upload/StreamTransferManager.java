/**
 * Manages streaming of data to S3 without knowing the size beforehand and without keeping it all in memory or
 * writing to disk.
 * <p>
 * The data is split into chunks and uploaded using the multipart upload API by one or more separate threads.
 * <p>
 * After creating an instance with details of the upload, use {@link StreamTransferManager#getMultiPartOutputStreams()}
 * to get a list
 * of {@link MultiPartOutputStream}s. When you finish writing data, call {@link MultiPartOutputStream#close()}.
 * Parts will be uploaded to S3 as you write.
 * <p>
 * Once all streams have been closed, call {@link StreamTransferManager#complete()}. Alternatively you can call
 * {@link StreamTransferManager#abort()}
 * at any point if needed.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example. A lot of the code relates to setting up threads for creating data unrelated to the library. The
 * essential parts are commented.
* <pre>{@code
    AmazonS3Client client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCreds);

    // Setting up
    int numStreams = 2;

                        String line = generateData(streamIndex, lineNum);

                        // Writing data and potentially sending off a part
                        outputStream.write(line.getBytes());
                    }

                    // The stream must be closed once all the data has been written
                    outputStream.close();
                } catch (Exception e) {

                    // Aborts all uploads
                    manager.abort(e);
                }
            }
        });

    pool.shutdown();
    pool.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    // Finishing off
    manager.complete();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The final file on S3 will then usually be the result of concatenating all the data written to each stream,
 * in the order that the streams were in in the list obtained from {@code getMultiPartOutputStreams()}. However this
 * may not be true if multiple streams are used and some of them produce less than 5 MB of data. This is because the multipart
 * upload API does not allow the uploading of more than one part smaller than 5 MB, which leads to fundamental limits
 * on what this class can accomplish. If order of data is important to you, then either use only one stream or ensure
 * that you write at least 5 MB to every stream.
 * <p>
 * While performing the multipart upload this class will create instances of {@link CreateMultipartUploadRequest},
 * {@link UploadPartRequest}, and {@link CompleteMultipartUploadRequest}, fill in the essential details, and send them
 * off. If you need to add additional details then override the appropriate {@code customise*Request} methods and
 * set the required properties within. Note that if no data is written (i.e. the object body is empty) then a normal (not multipart) upload will be performed and {@code customisePutEmptyObjectRequest} will be called instead.
 * <p>
 * This class does not perform retries when uploading. If an exception is thrown at any stage the upload will be aborted and the
 * exception rethrown, wrapped in a {@code RuntimeException}.
 * <p>
 * You can configure the upload process by calling any of the chaining setter methods {@link StreamTransferManager#numStreams(int)}, {@link StreamTransferManager#numUploadThreads(int)}, {@link StreamTransferManager#queueCapacity(int)}, or {@link StreamTransferManager#partSize(long)} before calling {@code getMultiPartOutputStreams}. Parts that have been produced sit in a queue of specified capacity while they wait for a thread to upload them.
 * The worst case memory usage is {@code (numUploadThreads + queueCapacity) * partSize + numStreams * (partSize + 6MB)},
 * while higher values for these first three parameters may lead to better resource usage and throughput.
 * If you are uploading very large files, you may need to increase the part size - see {@link StreamTransferManager#partSize(long)} for details.
